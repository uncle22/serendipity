These tests are built to run in either Pacific timezone or UTC -- no where else!  They will fail most egregiously.

At the very least, you would have to add mock timezone data for those timezones which are relative to your running timezone as America/New_York, Pacific/Honolulu, Pacific/Niue, and Asia/Kabul (good luck with that one) are to America/Los_Angeles.

Spare yourself a trip to the loony bin; just don't do it.
