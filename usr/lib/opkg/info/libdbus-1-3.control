Package: libdbus-1-3
Version: 1.6.8-r6.0.5
Description: D-Bus message bus
 D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to
 one another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps
 coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a
 \"single instance\" application or daemon, and to launch applications and
 daemons on demand when their services are needed.
