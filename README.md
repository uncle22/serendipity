This is the README file for the Team Serendipity git repo!

We are currently building the team, setting up the VMs, figuring out what the hell we're doing, and basically dicking off...

Soon enough we will begin construction on the Death Star.. I mean our spin on Open WebOS for the Galaxy Nexus! 

Our current members are:
PatimusxPrime - Patrick Healy, patimusxprime@gmail.com
jimmyco2008 - James Spinella, james.robert.spinella@gmail.com

Team Serendipity
